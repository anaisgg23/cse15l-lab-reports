# LAB REPORT #4 Vim
---
For the lab report this week, reproduce the task from above on your own. For each numbered step (steps 4-9), 
take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step.

## Step 4

**Keys pressed:** ssh agonzalezgomez@ieng6.ucsd.edu `<enter>`
- This new VSCode window did not have any memory of my ssh command so I typed it all completely and used enter to log in.

## Step 5

**Keys pressed:** git clone `<Ctrl+V>`, `<enter>`
- In order to clone my fork of the repository from my Github account I typed git clone and pasted my SSH url from Github using Ctrl+V and pressed enter.

## Step 6

**Keys pressed:** cd lab_ `<tab>`, `<enter>`, bash `<tab>`, `<enter>`
- To run the tests I had to change my directory to be lab_7 so I typed the first few characters "cd lab_" and used the tab key to autofill the rest of the line and pressed enter. Then I typed "bash" and pressed the tab key to auto-fill the rest of the command since test.sh is the only bash file and then pressed enter.

**Keys pressed:** vim ListExamples.java `<enter>`
- To enter vim I typed "vim ListExamples.java" and pressed enter to enter vim in ListExamples.java

**Keys pressed:** 


j x 43 times
l x 11 times
type rx over 
escape

Type  rx  to replace the character at the cursor with  x . **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.

  2. Move the cursor so that it is on top of the first error.

  3. Type   r   and then the character which should be there.

:wq <Enter> to save and exit
